# Copy-Script
Sometimes Nautilus crashes when you try to copy very big directories, and you certainly don't want to copy every single file on your own, this is when you can use this script!
This is a very simple script which copies every single file/directory from source to dest (unlike ```cp * ``` it shows which file is being copied at anytime).
