# Copy-Script
If sometimes Nautilus crashes when you try to copy very big directories, and you certainly don't want to drag and drop every file, this is for you!
This is a very simple script which copies every single file/directory from source to dest, showing you at anytime which file is being copied, unlike ```cp * ```.
